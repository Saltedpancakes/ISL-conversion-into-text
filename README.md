# ISL-conversion-into-text
This project converts Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into text displayed on an LCD screen, bridging communication gaps for those with hearing or speech impairments. It uses a camera for gesture capture, a machine learning model for recognition, and a microcontroller for processing and display, offering a real-time, accessible solution.
